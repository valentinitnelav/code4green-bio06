This repository contains code and data used during the [Code4Green hackathon](https://www.bmu.de/en/service/events/wettbewerbe/code4green/) by the team team_cli07_landscapeoptimizer (initial team name - Bio06). The presentation of the project is on Devpost, [here](https://devpost.com/software/cli07_landscapeoptimizer).

# Check out our study case

[**Here is a report**](https://rpubs.com/valentin/study-case) on a study case of a user that would give as input three different crop scenarios.

[**Here is a minimal app/dashboard**](https://valentin-stefan.shinyapps.io/app_shiny_bio06/) that computes the landscape diversity metrics for three given crop scenarios. The dashboard is in a minimalistic form and currently acts as a proof of concept. The user would input data about her/his crops and then after clicking on "Calculate", gets some graphs about landscape diversity metrics.

# Directories

- **study_case** contains the spatial data and the code used to generate the [html report](https://rpubs.com/valentin/study-case);

- **app_shiny_bio06** contains code and data for running online a simple interactive dashboard hosted on a Shiny server - [here: app_shiny_bio06](https://valentin-stefan.shinyapps.io/app_shiny_bio06/);

- **BackendData** contains sample data used for the back-end calculations;

- **DataPreparation** contains the scripts used for data cleaning and preparation

- **sandbox** was used only for testing ideas, minimal examples, exploratory stuff.
